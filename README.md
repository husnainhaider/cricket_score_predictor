## Cricket Score Predictor

This project is a web application built with Streamlit to predict the score of an innings in a Pakistan Super League (PSL) cricket match. The prediction is based on user inputs including the batting team, bowling team, match city, current score, overs completed, wickets fallen, and runs scored in the last 5 overs.

- **Batting Team**: Select the batting team from the dropdown list.
- **Bowling Team**: Select the bowling team from the dropdown list.
- **City**: Select the city where the match is being played.
